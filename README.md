# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Breast Cancer Classification

## Objective
Use SVM to classify breast cancer cases using both linear and RBF kernels. Evaluate and tune using cross-validation.

## Tasks Done
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernels
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
- Visualized results using PCA projection

## Tools Used
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
- Best Accuracy (RBF Kernel with tuning): 98%+
